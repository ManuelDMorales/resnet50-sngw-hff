# Summary

Deep residual network (ResNet50) to classify RGB images of time-frequency (TF) Morlet wavelet scalograms of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). We performed a three-class classification, in which the target label is assigned if the slope of the High Frequency Feature, present in the scalograms, belongs to one of three slope ranges. This three-class classification allows us to study the detectability of the HFF because, depending on the CCSN model and the noise realization, the visibility of the HFF can vary.

This project draws on datasets generated in projects [datagen-sngw-phen](https://github.com/ManuelDMorales/datagen-sngw-phen) and [datagen-sngw-genrel](https://github.com/ManuelDMorales/datagen-sngw-genrel), which consist of window strain time series containing interferometric noise plus gravitational waves from CCSNe. Jupyter notebooks developed in Python by Manuel D. Morales (e-mail: <manueld.morales@academicos.udg.mx>).

# Science background

The samples used in this project consist of time series of real noise from LIGO (L1, H1) and (V1) interferometric detectors from the O3b run plus gravitational wave signals from CCSN, bot phenomenological waveforms, and general relativistic waveforms. In all cases, these waveforms contain the HFF which, depending on the model and the noise, is more or less visible.

Phenomenological waveforms come from a stochastic non-physical model that mimics the HFF, see [Astone et al Phys. Rev. D 98, 122002 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.98.122002). On the other hand, general relativistic waveforms are a modified version of those obtained from three multidimensional CCSN simulations: [Andresen 2019 m15nr h+](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz990), [Morozova 2018 M13_SFHo h+](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aac5f1), and [Cerda-Duran 2013 fiducial h+](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/779/2/L18). The modification of the general relativistic waveforms has to do with the fact that all features other than the HFF were removed or filtered.

The three target labels for the classification are defined as follows:

- Class 1:  1,620 =< HFF slope =< 4,990
- Class 2: 1,450 =< HFF slope < 1,620
- Class 3: 950 =< HFF slope < 1,450

Fig. 1 Shows the ResNet50 architecture used in this project. This is formed by five stages in which identity blocks and/or convolutional blocks are applied, plus a classification stage with a dense (fully connected) layer with a softmax activation giving three probabilistic scores per class. Besides, after stages 1 and 5, a max pooling and an average pooling, respectively, are applied to reduce the system resources. Also notice that at the beginning, a zero padding is applied to the input data.

The codes were run in Google Colaboratory, in the following order:

`Convert_StrainImage.ipynb` for reading window strain datasets and converting them into RGB images of TF Morlet wavelet pixelized scalograms. Data can be loaded by two folders: PhenWf and GenRelWf for phenomenological waveforms and general relativistic waveforms, respectively. Moreover, for general relativistic waveforms, datasets are loaded for folders at different distances (see important instruction no. 2 detailed below). RGB images are generated by simply copying each pixel of the grayscale TF image into their respective pixels in red, green (G), and blue (B) channels.

`Apply_ResNet50.ipynb` for apply the ResNet50 model. This script has a high-level structure consisting of two big sections: the first is for training and testing with phenomenological waveforms, and the second is for testing with general relativistic waveforms.

# Important instruction

1. All scripts were run in a specific Google Drive location, then you will need to edit the high-level path location in which the project (resnet50-sngw-hff) is located.
   
2. Notice that the Datasets folder, as shown in the project's tree, has a specific hierarchical structure. Excepting the number of distances (which can be more or less than 3), it is highly recommended to maintain this structure, to have a reasonable organization of the datasets, and to run the `Convert_StrainImage.ipynb` script without path locations changes inside the folder of the project. Then, if you run codes datagen-sngw-phen and/or datagen-sngw-genrel to generate datasets, located output folders (syntax: detector_GPStime) inside the PhenWf folder and/or the GenRelWf/Distance_dKpc (with "d" the distance from the CCSN), respectively.

3. The first section of `Apply_ResNet50.ipynb` script is more computationally intensive to run than its second section. Then, after running GridSearch CV and finding the best hyperparameter combination (section 7.2), the ResNet50 is trained with these hyperparameters, and the final model is saved in the Models/Best_training folder. If you run in this form, always save the best model to make it easily available for testing with phenomenological and general relativistic waveforms.

5. `Apply_ResNet50.ipynb` script has two input parameter fields: subsection I.1. for phenomenological waveforms, and subsection II.2. for general relativistic waveforms. Both sections requires information about the configuration of interferometers' data, but only the second the information about the distance from the CCSN.

6. For testing purposes, subsection II.5 of `Apply_ResNet50.ipynb` script can be omitted. This was implemented for exploratory data analysis with general relativistic waveforms, considering the whole dataset, namely the TF Morlet wavelet image samples at the three default distances (1, 5, and 10 Kpc) with the three CCSN models. If you run this subsection with less data, it will surely give you errors.
   
7. Saving plots as images is not mandatory in the codes. However, if you want it, you will need to create a folder "Figures" at the highest folder hierarchy of the project, and to uncomment line(s) with the plt.savefig statements in the scripts, for the desired plot(s).
