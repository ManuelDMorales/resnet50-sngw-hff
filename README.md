# Summary
Python implementation for characterizing the high frequency feature (HFF) in Gravitational Waves (GW) emitted by Core-Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe). This implementation begins with the generation of a dataset scalogram images containg GW events embedded in real LIGO-Virgo noise, and then apply a ResNet50 model to classify images according the slope of the HFF present in the scalograms.

Deep residual network (ResNet50) to classify the high frequency feature in gravitational waves emitted by core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). This implementation draws on datasets generated in projects [datagen-sngw-phen](https://github.com/ManuelDMorales/datagen-sngw-phen) and [datagen-sngw-genrel](https://github.com/ManuelDMorales/datagen-sngw-genrel), which consist of window strain time series containing interferometric noise plus gravitational waves from CCSNe. In this project, we convert these strain time samples to time-frequency (TF) Morlet wavelet scalograms. Then, these TF scalograms were converted to RGB images to be inputted to the ResNet50 model.
